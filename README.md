# Party Heartbeat
Displays an overlay and sends a notification when party members have not sent a ping for some configurable amount of ticks. This can be very useful to save your hcim friends at content where escape crystals are available.

F.A.Q.

Sometimes the party plugin can be a little janky, and will have multiple instances of the same user. If this happens, join another party channel and it should resolve itself.

Testing the plugin is as simple as getting a friend in the party with the plugin on to close their client.

The runelite notifications are disabled by default.
If you want to use the runelite notification settings, they can be found at:
